govready
========

An accreditation-helper toolkit to make FISMA easier.

# Vision 
The GovReady vision is to make FISMA easier for innovators by

- making compliance part of Agile/DevOps
- sharing compliance progress data among Dev, Ops, Sec, and Mgt
- making baseline development collaborative
- providing trusted SCAP content with open source friendly licenses
- embracing compliance as a practice distinct from security


# Product
Our first product is "govready", a toolkit for running FISMA scans and managing results with a git-like feel. 

Govready uses (and is a contributor to) the NIST Certified SCAP 1.2 toolkit [OpenSCAP](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap) and [Scap-Security-Guide](https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide). 

Our design goal is to make scanning easier and more collaborative regardless of your knowledge of FISMA.

# Project Status
Govready is under heavy development and is pre-release. The current version is 0.4.x.

We recommend only using govready currently on non-production virtual machines. 

Feedback via GitHub issues is appreciated!

The govready toolkit is funded by a generous grant from the [John S and James L Knight Foundation](http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201345714/)

# Get Started

Below are several quickstarts. Use the quickstart for your preferred OS.

( Need a vm to test GovReady? Try: https://github.com/GovReady/testmachines )

### RedHat 6, 7 quickstart (64 bit)

```
# Update nss to pre-emptively avoid problems with EPEL certificates (https://github.com/GovReady/govready/issues/64)
# Alternate if epel installed: sudo yum --disablerepo="epel" update nss -y
sudo yum clean all
sudo yum update nss -y


# Install govready using curl. govready will install OpenSCAP and SCAP-Security-Content
curl -Lk io.govready.org/install | sudo bash

# Switch to root so scanner can run all tests properly
# It's OK. You are using a non-production vm, right?
su - 

# Create a directory and cd into it
mkdir myfisma
cd myfisma

# Initialize the directory
govready init

# Run a scan
govready scan

# List results
ls -l scans

# View repoort from most recent scan
lynx scans/results.html

# Run fix script generated by most recent OpenSCAP scan
govready fix

# Compare before and after scans. Compares rules with 'pass' results in most recent scan to results in second most recent scan.
govready compare

# Compare before and after scans to see if anything fails passed in second most recent scan.
govready compare fail

# Information and evaluation of individual rule (rule must be listed in results.xml file)
govready rule configure_auditd_num_logs

# See available profiles (e.g., baselines)
govready profiles

# Run a scan for a different profile (e.g., baseline)
govready scan usgcb-rhel6-server

# Run an autogenerated fix script from available remediations in the SCAP content
# Example - your file name may differ
bash scan/usgcb-rhel6-server-fix-0822-1552.sh

```

### Centos 6 quickstart (64 bit)
Note: CentOS is NOT RHEL without subscription. There is a general assumption that SSG tests for RHEL work on CentOS, but that is not guaranteed.

```
# Install govready using curl. govready will install OpenSCAP and SCAP-Security-Content
curl -Lk io.govready.org/install | sudo bash

# Switch to root so scanner can run all tests properly
su - 

# Create a directory and cd into it
mkdir myfisma
cd myfisma

# Initialize the directory
govready init

# Import CentOS cpe-dictionary.xml and cpe-oval.xml SCAP data into local scap/content directory
govready import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GovReady/govready/xplatform/templates/ssg-centos6-cpe-dictionary.xml
govready import https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GovReady/govready/xplatform/templates/ssg-centos6-cpe-oval.xml

# Update GovReadyfile using sed command (or update the CPE line manually using a text editor)
sed -i 's:^CPE.*:CPE = scap/content/ssg-centos6-cpe-dictionary.xml:' GovReadyfile

# Run a scan
govready scan

# List results
ls -l scans

# View repoort from most recent scan
lynx scans/results.html

# Run fix script generated by most recent OpenSCAP scan
govready fix

# Compare before and after scans. Compares rules with 'pass' results in most recent scan to results in second most recent scan.
govready compare

# Compare before and after scans to see if anything fails passed in second most recent scan.
govready compare fail

# Information and evaluation of individual rule (rule must be listed in results.xml file)
govready rule configure_auditd_num_logs

# See available profiles (e.g., baselines)
govready profiles

# Run a scan for a different profile (e.g., baseline)
govready scan usgcb-rhel6-server

# Run an autogenerated fix script from available remediations in the SCAP content
# Example - your file name may differ
bash scan/usgcb-rhel6-server-fix-0822-1552.sh

```


### Ubuntu 12 and 14 quick start (64 bit)

```
# Install govready using curl. govready will install OpenSCAP and SCAP-Security-Content
curl -Lk io.govready.org/install | sudo bash

# Switch to root so scanner can run all tests properly
su - 

# Create a directory and cd into it
mkdir myfisma
cd myfisma

# Initialize the directory
govready init

# Run an oscap command just to see things fail because we have no SCAP content installed for Ubuntu
oscap xccdf eval --profile test --results scans/test-results-0822-1319.xml --report scans/test-results-0822-1319.html  /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-xccdf.xml

# Sorry - this is all you can do on Ubuntu at the moment. :-(
# Fork the code and help us include Ubuntu and Debi

```
